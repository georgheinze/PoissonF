# Simulation study

The simulation study was originally planned in two batches; one without rate multipliers (varying follow-up times) and one with.
During work on this project we decided to omit the branch without rate multipliers as it is only a well-behaved special case of the branch with varying rate multipliers.
Originally, this batch was called 'Follow-up time batch', hence all the files can be found in the corresponding subfolder.
